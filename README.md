# vue2.0-webpack-demo
I built the first one myself of vue2.0 and webpack demo.
The modules used in the project are {
                                      "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
                                      "babel-loader": "^7.1.2",

                                      "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",
                                      "babel-runtime": "^5.8.38",

                                      "vue": "^2.4.4",
                                      "vue-hot-reload-api": "^2.1.1",
                                      "vue-html-loader": "^1.2.4",
                                      "vue-loader": "^13.0.5",
                                      "vue-style-loader": "^3.0.3",
                                      "vue-template-compiler": "^2.4.4",
                                      "webpack": "^3.6.0",
                                      "webpack-dev-middleware": "^1.12.0",
                                      "webpack-dev-server": "^2.9.1",
                                      "webpack-hot-middleware": "^2.19.1"
                                    }

I encountered a lot of problems in the process of building.I learned a lot init.
I hope it will be better in the future and be a good front end Engineer.
